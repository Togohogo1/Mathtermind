            ;guess 10 7 8 4 -> guesses 10, 7, 8, and 4

        visualized as follows: Imagine 2 sets of numbers, the winning combination and
        the user's guess. Numbers appearing in both sets are removed from both sets, and
        the removal process repeats until nothing can be removed. The number of pairs
        removed is the number of matches.

        After the user's final guess, the bot will respond with a win/lose message.
